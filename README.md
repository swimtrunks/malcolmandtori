We are getting married!

I wanted to develop a page for our wedding on this year. 

The goal (as always) is to make a fully responsive page for our wedding this year. 
I have already gotten most of the styling down but I'm still working on getting the colors perfect.

I wanted to use css/sass because I love organizing the stylesheets for ease of use, jQuery because I wanted more 
experience with that library(and its pretty simple to implement in anything) and bootstrap for the form just so I could
have more experience modifying code that I didnt write and being able to implement Bootstrap templates into my own pages.

Still debating if I want to have it be one page, or multiple. 
I could just have the links at the top scroll to the index on click, but I might just try to do both that and having other pages.

Did desktop first, next time ill work with mobile first mentaility because its always easier to do it that way.

Biggest Challenge:
Designing in browser. wanted to try to design as I go and it has slowed me a decent amount (not to mention most design 
decisions must be ran by tori as well). Overall its going well, just taking a little longer to wrap up than expected.
