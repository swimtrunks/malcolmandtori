"Malcolm and Tori" : Wedding Website

<h2>We are getting married!</h2>

<h3>Objective:</h3>
I wanted to design and build a website from scratch for our wedding. I have built most of the page already but I have decided to rebuild it using React.js. I implemented animation by having an image that fades in when it comes into frame. 

<h3>What's Next:</h3>
Like I stated earlier, I will rebuild this in React and restructure and redesign the page. I will also be building a backend for capturing visitor info and messages from a "Contact Us" form. I currently used a placeholder form that uses bootstrap but I will rebuild the form itself so that I can get rid of the unreadable markup. 

<h3>Technologies:</h3>

- HTML
- CSS/SASS
- JavaScript/ jQuery
